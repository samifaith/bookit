# ðŸ“š BookIt!

**Demo Day Project**
I built an application called BookIt which gives readers just what they need for a personalized reading experience. Have you ever finished reading a really great book and didnâ€™t know what to choose next? Or did you ever want to explore a new genre but didnâ€™t know where to start? BookIt knows your preferences based on your social interactions and past reading options that then provides you with options you may have never considered.
